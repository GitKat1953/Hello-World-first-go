#Hello-World-first-go
Following the instructions as a first-timer on GitHub, seeking to get my brain cells in action and make progress on my Data Science course with Skills Network Labs
As of 16th October 2021, everything is this area is totally new to me.
Certainly, I have downloaded an open software program from GitHub and I have seen the name GitHub referenced many times, but _USING_ it...!
:-)

- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitKat1953...I think!
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, just now in Python...

- 🌱 I’m currently studying 2 basic courses of Python: Postgres for Everyone and Python for Everyone (Michigan MOOC).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NOTHING yet as I have very little to offer in such collaboration. I am in the process of putting my first Jupiter notebook up for sharing, being a good boy who follows and listens to instructions given in his course! :-P
- That's always a good way to start.

- 📫 How to reach me: use email address "barry.shaw53@kinect.co.nz" and address me as GitKat1953.
